How to save the image's coordinate and the predicted coordinate for later 
comparison in plotting? 



1. Serv_test to start the communication with Neocleo. Hit run the current script
hit enter respond to enable and hit stop to end the program. This program is to make 
the setting to activata left sensor "1" of the Neocleo board and acquire histogram data 
instead of the default gui or range data. 

2. Seventh.py is the main training and vaidation program, it also imports color_mask.py,
cv_plot.py and dict_mapping.py files to run the mapping and major task. It is prompted to
write an trainng file which will be used as training data that will be invoked by 
dict_mapping.py to see the previous saved training data to compare the
the current data. Trainning data are saved as m-dd-yy-t#. If we have training data to be 
invoked from dict_mapping.py, at the prompt of "writing a file for training data?" we can 
also save it as a validation file. The validation data are saved as m-dd-yy-v#

3. dict_mapping.py will invoke a training data, saved as 
m-dd-yy-(finger)t#. After the file name is changed, save the file 
for the new training data to take effect.


4.supporting programs also includes color_mask.py amd cv.plot.py,
just like dict_mapping above. color_mask.py imports dict_mapping.py 
and uses openCV to get the coordinats of the objcets (ball or finger), 
and traces.  cv_plot.py is used to plot bar graphs.
